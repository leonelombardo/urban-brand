                      Nike Skateboarding teamed up with legendary psychedelic rock band Grateful Dead to release the Nike SB Dunk Low Grateful Dead Bears Yellow, now available on urban. The design theme of this collaboration pays homage to the Grateful Dead Bears, a series of stylized dancing bears illustrated by Bob Thomas on the back cover of the album History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice) in 1973. The SB Dunk Low Grateful Dead Bears Yellow features a fuzzy yellow faux-fur upper with suede overlays and a jagged Swoosh to represent the stylization of the bear's chest fur. A hidden stash pocket is featured inside the tongue that is perfect for extra storage. A yellow midsole, blue outsole, and signature Grateful Dead branding on the tongue complete this euphoric design. These sneakers released in July of 2020 and retailed for $110 USD.

                      The only way to describe the Travis Scott Air Jordan 4 Retros properly would be to use the rappers own adlib: la flame. These Jordan 4s were made in collaboration with rapper, Travis Scott and nicknamed the "Cactus Jack" edition. Similar in design to the infamous Eminem pair, these feature a lighter shade of blue suede on the upper. Black accents, a red liner, paint splatter detailing, a white midsole and "Cactus Jack" branding on the back heel tab finish things off for this pair. These dropped in June of 2018 for $225 and came exclusively in men's sizes. If you're a fan of Travis Scott and the AJ 4, this pair is another must-have. Straight up!

                      From the school-spirited College Colors Program to the vibrant Nike CO.JP collection, Nike Dunks have seen many colorways since the design's inception in 1985. But with each new colorway, the Dunk's classic color-blocking has remained in some capacity. Nike put its timeless color-blocking to work with the Nike Dunk Low Retro White Black. The upper Nike Dunk Low Retro White Black is constructed of white leather with black leather overlays and Swooshes. Classic Nike branding is featured on the nylon tongue, nodding to traditional Dunk design elements. A white midsole and black outsole completes the design. The Nike Dunk Low Retro White Black released in January of 2021 and retailed for $100.

                      Jordan Brand continued their Black Toe design theme in 2020 and released the Jordan 1 High Dark Mocha, now available on urban.
